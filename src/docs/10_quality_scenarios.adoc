****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.

=== Quality Tree

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

.Form
Tabular or free form text.

In this section we take a deeper look at some of the quality requirements mentioned in the quality tree:
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Type|Explanation
|Responsiveness| The application should use the minimum amount of system resources in order to work smoothly in most current devices
|Response Time| The notifications, storage, share features and POD management should take the least amount of time as possible (less than 2s).
|Error Handling| Lighter errors should take no next to no hit on system performance and fatal errors must be notified in detail to the user
|Multi-device support| The application must work across a wide range of devices with different sizes and different platforms 
|Data portability| Routes are stored in a format that allows the use of said files in other  route-oriented applications 
|Share Features| Users are the only entities capable of allow sharing of their routes to other users
|Permissions| The application must ask permission to the user in order to gain access to funcionality of the device such as GPS signal, wireless communication and such others
|Accessibility| The app must meet at least the minimum accessibility standards in order to guarantee a wide user base
|Offline access| Routes stored in local storage must be access at any point by the user, even if the device is offline
|Look and Feel| The app should be good looking and the interface needs to be desgined in a way that allows a coherent aesthetic between all the options and accessible at the same time
|Social Features| All social features such as share routes or send files to other users are blocked unless the user is authenticated. Otherwise the user cannot use said options
|Data Storage| Users have the choice of storing their routes locally in the device while maintaining a copy in their POD
