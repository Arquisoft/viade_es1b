== Quality Requirements


[role="arc42help"]

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.

|=======================
|Type|Explanation
|Responsiveness| The application should use the minimum amount of system resources in order to work smoothly in most current devices
|Response Time| The notifications, storage, share features and POD management should take the least amount of time as possible (less than 2s).
|Error Handling| Lighter errors should take no next to no hit on system performance and fatal errors must be notified in detail to the user
|Multi-device support| The application must work across a wide range of devices with different sizes and different platforms 
|Data portability| Routes are stored in a format that allows the use of said files in other  route-oriented applications 
|Share Features| Users are the only entities capable of allow sharing of their routes to other users
|Permissions| The application must ask permission to the user in order to gain access to funcionality of the device such as GPS signal, wireless communication and such others
|Accessibility| The app must meet at least the minimum accessibility standards in order to guarantee a wide user base
|Offline access| Routes stored in local storage must be access at any point by the user, even if the device is offline
|Look and Feel| The app should be good looking and the interface needs to be desgined in a way that allows a coherent aesthetic between all the options and accessible at the same time
|Social Features| All social features such as share routes or send files to other users are blocked unless the user is authenticated. Otherwise the user cannot use said options
|Data Storage| Users have the choice of storing their routes locally in the device while maintaining a copy in their POD
