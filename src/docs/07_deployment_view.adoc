.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. the technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. the mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document the deployment view when your software is executed as distributed system with more then one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture those elements of the infrastructure that are needed to show the deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe the infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence your system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, you need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe the highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section you will
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than the deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

[role="arc42help"]
Users must have a device with an Internet connection and a web browser, preferably Firefox or Chrome, which are the web browsers with which we have developed the Viade application. It is also more recommended computer than mobile device since it is not optimized for the latter. The Viade application is hosted and working on GitHubPages. In order to access the web application it is necessary to have acquired a Solid POD, it can be obtained from the Solid Inrupt page or from the Solid Community. The POD will be on a Solid server.

Motivation::

The motivation is that users can transparently use the PODs and be able to see their routes and save them.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

Performance can be affected by three factors:
* Internet connection of the user. Uncontrollable from us
* POD server. Also uncontrollable by us
* Code performance. This if uncontrollable on our part. From which we are committed to using the best code that provides the best performance

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
It looks good in the diagram but the main components of the application are:
* the user's device (PC, tablets, mobile, ...)
* the web browser (Firefoz, Chrome, ...)
* the web server (GitHub pages)
* the user's POD (Inrupt or Comunnity)
* the POD's server 
* the app itselft


=== Infrastructure Level 2

Here you can include the internal structure of (some) infrastructure elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.
