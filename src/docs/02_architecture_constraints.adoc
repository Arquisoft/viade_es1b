== Architecture Constraints

****
.Software Constraints
|===
|Constraint |Explanation
|React |This year, teachers told us that React must be used in our project
|SOLID Specifications |None of us have knowledge about SOLID, so we have to invest our time learning how to use it

.Organizational Constraints
|===
|Constraint |Explanation
|Time |We only have one semester to develop the application. Assuming we haven't knowledge about technologies involved and having the deadline on 4th May, we may have problems completing all the checkpoints required.
|Team |We are 6 persons in the team and we had never worked together before.

Constraints are fixed technical or bussiness-oriented design decisions that absolutely cannot be changed (maybe negotiable).
Most often these are provided by stakeholders at the outset of the project.
Sometimes a team may choose to create a constraint,
perhaps to simplify the world in which they are working

.The main constraints are the following

|=======================
|Constraint|Explanation
|SOLID     | We are forced to use the SOLID framework and its features in order to develop our application   
|ReactJS   | The use of the ReactJS framework
|Decentralized network system    | Being able to develop a functional project while maintaining the decentralized network system having in consideration all the challenges it may bring to the team   
|PODs      | Make good use of the POD system and its advantages in order to accomplish the goals and features that the application requires
|Independentcy| Make sure that the files that store the routes are independent of the application
|Flexible Web Interface| Implementation of a web interface flexible enough to be used in a variety of devices
|Tests	   | The need of implementing a variety of tests in order to maintain the funcionality of the application and find possible bugs
|Version Control| The use of a GitHub repository in order to keep the development of the project in check and always available
|Geo file standard| The need of searching and choosing a file format to store the routes
|Time schedule| We have limited time to deliver a final version in May/June
|Code coverage| The use of certain tools in order to evaluate the quality of the code itself.
