== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

=== System Constraints

[role="arc42help"]
****
Constraints are fixed technical or bussiness-oriented desing decisions that absolutely cannot be changed (maybe negotiable).
Most often these are provided by stakeholders at the outset of the project.
Sometimes a team may choose to create a constraint,
perhaps to simplify the world in which they are working

.The main constraints are the following

|=======================
|Constraint|Explanation
|SOLID     | We are forced to use the SOLID framework and its features in order to develop our application   
|ReactJS   | The use of the ReactJS framework
|Decentralized network system    | Being able to develop a functional project while maintaining the decentralized network system having in consideration all the challenges it may bring to the team   
|PODs      | Make good use of the POD system and its advantages in order to accomplish the goals and features that the application requieres
|Independentcy| Make sure that the files that store the routes are independent of the application
|Flexible Web Interface| Implementation of a web interface flexible enough to be used in a variety of devices
|Tests	   | The need of implementing a variety of tests in order to maintain the funcionality of the application and find possible bugs
|Version Control| The use of a GitHub repository in order to keep the development of the project in check and always available
|Geo file standard| The need of searching and choosing a file format to store the routes
|Time schedule| We have limited time to deliver a final version in May/June
|Code coverage| The use of certain tools in order to evaluate the quality of the code itself.
