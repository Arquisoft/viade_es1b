== Introduction and Goals

The intention of this project, Viade, is to create and develop a route management system, such as Wikiloc, but with the difference that it's done in a decentralized way, which means that the app and data storage are independent so your data is only yours and you decide who you share it with.
To carry out this this app, we are using SOLID specifications and the React framework.

=== Requirements Overview

.Functional requirements
* Users can view their routes on a map and store them in their own pods.

* An user can get notifications when some friend shares a route with him.

* To register routes, users must have a POD, so they have to log in and authenticate in SOLID inrupt or community.

* Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route.

* View routes that had been loaded in other apps.

.Non functional requirements

* Ease of learning to interact whith the app by new users.

* Small response and loading times.

* Security and privacy: no vulnerability points.

* Accessibility and usability level following the recommendations of W3C.

* Not having a central database, which compromises the information of the users that use it.


=== Quality Goals
The priority will go in decreasing order. The number one will be the most priority and will decrease the priority
|===
| Priority | Quality goal | Scenario 

| 1 | Security | An user doesn't want to share his information with another one unless he gives him permission.
| 2 | Usability | There is a new user in our app and he wants to start to use all its functionality as soon as possible.
| 3 | Efficiency | When an user wants to load a route, it must be in a short time.
| 4 | Mantainability | The developer team wants to add more functionality to the application.
| 5 | Compatibility | Someone wants to share his route from other app with some user that is using Viade.
