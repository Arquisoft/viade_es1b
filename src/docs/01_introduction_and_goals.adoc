== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

* underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
* quality goals for the architecture
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
The intention of this project, Viade, is to create and develop a decentralized route management system based on SOLID specifications and using the React framework. The proyect will be developed in a system with a decentralized architecture, where its users find the storage of separate application data. Other goals are also: that users can save the data of their routes in their corresponding PODs, users can view, on the map, their routes, the application will allow the user to share multimedia content or other files with their friends and also can obtain notifications when a friend wants to share a route with him.Another objective is that they can be formed groups of friends, with whom you can share a route. Besides, it should be possible to see the routes loaded by users of other different apps, which means that the application has to have interoperability with other route management systems.

Viade is an application to upload and share your trails, like Wikiloc, but with the difference that it's done in a decentralized way. This means that the app and data storage are independent so your data is only yours and you decid who you share it with. 



=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.
****
.Functional requirements
* Users can view their routes on a map and store them in their own pods.

* A user can get notifications when some friend shares a route with him.

* To register routes, users must have a POD, so they have to log in and authenticate in SOLID inrupt or community.

* Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route

* View routes that had been loaded in other apps.

.No functional requirements

* Ease of learning to interact whith te app by new users.

* Small response and loading times

* Security and privacy: no vulnerability points

* Accessibility and usability level following the recommendations of W3C.

* Not having a central database, which compromises the information of the users that use it.


=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged â€¦

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
