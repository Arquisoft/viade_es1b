== Cross-cutting Concepts
This section is intended to describe the general ideas, regulations and concepts that apply, either to the whole system, or to several parts of it.
[role="arc42help"]
=== Domain concepts ===
* A route contains a unique name and consists of a series of points, which must be at least two.
* Map points contain longitude and latitude
* Pod: user repository, following the SOLID specification. It can be located anywhere, not on a single platform.
* Client: the viade program running on the user’s browser. Its responsability is to give the functionality, not to store the data.

=== User Experience ===
For us the user experience is a high priority in our application. So we made a commitment to make an application in which the maps and all the functionality were iterative.

=== Architecture and design patterns ===
Up until know, the viade is an React system, therefore following the Model View Controller architectural pattern. However, all our application would not store any of the user’s data. It will access it via SOLID pods.

=== Persistency ===
Persistence has been achieved using JSON and multiple converters to different types. It has also been achieved using an RDF standard. Persistence in Viade will be achieved following the SOLID specification.

=== Testing ===
Two types of testing are currently in place:

* Unit testing: in charge of testing the low level features of the system.

* End to end: in charge of testing the general behavior of the system by mocking a real user.

=== Building ===

The building of the project, considering that it is an React application, is done via the Node.js package manages, npm. It is expected to be built using the docker platform, in order to avoid dependencies and enviorment issues.

=== Security ===
The application will use secure communication channels. We will use the protocol https://introbay.com/es/blog/2016/07/05/https-que-es-y-para-que-sirve[HTTPS]. With them we ensure te authenticity and integrity of the data sended and received from the pods.

=== Internacionalization ===
The application will be internationalized to the two most spoken languages ​​in the world, Spanish and English. We believe it is a good way to reach a higher number of users.

.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.
