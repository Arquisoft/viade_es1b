== Building Block View
The main structure of this project consist on dividing the app in a lot of small parts that will be inside a bigger one.

Some of this parts will be the different components of the application that will contain the files referred to the user interface and some logic related to that component. There is also a folder intended for the logic that manages the whole interaction between components.

Another important part of the structure is the folder containing the domain model of the application.

|===
|Name|Responsability
|Actor|It is the user who uses our application. It can be a hiker, a cyclist, ..
|Viade| It's our web app
|POD's|It is the storage server of the routes and with which our application connects
|===

**Level 1**

image::Level1.png[]

In the first level we can divide our app in three blocks:

|===
|Name|Responsability
|Actor|It is the user who uses our application. It can be a hiker, a cyclist, ..
|Coomponents| They are the components that are seen in the application and makes them work.
|Services|They are the services that make us connect with the POD's, log in and use the app's utilities
|Model|It is the set of all the entities that make up the application, including the parsers
|===

**Level 2**

image::Level2.png[]

In the second level we focus on the components block, because we believe that it is the most important, to differentiate between the five big parts of the web application in the part of Components :

|===
|Name|Responsability
|Map|It is where the routes are shown, where they are created, ...
|Profile| The profile is where you can configure your profile in this application, see your routes, ...
|Settings|The Settings can be changed by different details of the application
|Friends|Here you can see your friends, their routes, the shared routes,...
|===


In the services part, the following should be highlighted (there are more services):

|===
|Name|Responsability
|UploadRoutes|This service is responsible for uploading your routes to your pod
|CreateRoute|This service is responsible for converting the map points into a JSON format path
|DownloadRoute|This service is responsible for downloading the routes in the form of JSON and displays them in map format with points
|ShareRoute|This service is responsible for sharing the routes with your friends
|===

For example here there are many more services such as the login or the pod but we wanted to highlight the main functions of the app

Each of these parts is divided into many little components but it would be going into many details and the documentation would be very extensive and without important information 

=== Whitebox Overall System

We divided the code in three big blocks to separate the presentation from the logic and the domain (MVC).

image::WhiteboxOverallSystem.png[]

|===
| Block          | Description 
| Components    | In this block we find the presentation of the web. It is also divided into five blocks that covers the whole application: Profile, Map, Friends, Login and Settings. All the elements that form these blocks have a css, js and html files  
| Services | This block manages the logic of the application and the communication between the presentation and the model
| Model   | The model covers all the entities that are managed by the application. The routes have attributes such as longitude, latitude and height

.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.
****

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

_**<Overview Diagram>**_

Motivation::

_<text explanation>_


Contained Building Blocks::
_<Description of contained building block (black boxes)>_

Important Interfaces::
_<Description of important interfaces>_

[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.
****


==== <Name black box 1>

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

_<Purpose/Responsibility>_

_<Interface(s)>_

_<(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics>_

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_




==== <Name black box 2>

_<black box template>_

==== <Name black box n>

_<black box template>_


==== <Name interface 1>

...

==== <Name interface m>



=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

==== White Box _<building block 1>_

[role="arc42help"]

...describes the internal structure of _building block 1_.

==== White Box _<building block 2>_

...

==== White Box _<building block m>_


_<white box template>_



=== Level 3

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
