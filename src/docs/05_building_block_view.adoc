== Building Block View
The main structure of this project consist on dividing the app in a lot of small parts that will be inside a bigger one.

Some of this parts will be the different components of the application that will contain the files referred to the user interface and some logic related to that component. There is also a folder intended for the logic that manages the whole interaction between components.

Another important part of the structure is the folder containing the domain model of the application.

|===
|Name|Responsability
|Actor|It is the user who uses our application. It can be a hiker, a cyclist, ..
|Viade| It's our web app
|POD's|It is the storage server of the routes and with which our application connects
|===

**Level 1**

image::Level1.png[]

Contained blackboxes:

|===
|Name|Responsability
|<<Map>>|It is in charge of handling the entire issue of viewing the map, showing routes downloaded from the POD and uploading routes to your POD. That is why it communicates with Leaflet, outside of our application. It also communicates with Notifications with which it can send notifications. Lastly, it communicates with the POD to be able to upload or download the routes.
|<<Notifications>>| It is in charge of sending messages to the user. Receive the message of why this notification is sent and from the friends to whom it should be sent and leave it lodged in it. Then he can read them from there.
|<<Friends>>|The friends are in charge of receiving and sending the friendships of the POD. Also friends who are erased. Communicates with notifications only when you add a friend to let them know.
|===

**Level 2**

=== Map

image::Level2Map.png[]

Contained blackboxes:

|===
|Name|Responsability
|MapView|It is the view of the map and its utilities. Receive the map components and display them
|MapComponents| It is all you need to show all window utilities in the right places. It also gives the possibility to create your route
|Friends|Here the friends are shown to later share a route. You need the friendsManager to be able to show them
|ShareRoutes|Use the friends and the route that is drawn on the map to send it to the POD of the selected friend
|UploadRoutes|Take the route created in the MapView and adding a name and optionally, photos and videos, the service takes care of uploading it to your POD
|DownloadRoutes|When requesting this service, access your POD, and from which it shows them on the map
|===

=== Notifications

image::Level2Notifications.png[]

Contained blackboxes:

|===
|NotificationsView|It is the notifications tab. Receive the components to be seen and receive all the notifications from the POD
|NotificationsComponents|It is all you need to show all window utilities in the right places
|NotificationManager|Manages the flow of when you have to show or send notifications. When they load the notifications tab, send the receiver to act and pass the notifications to them to be painted. When you have to send them, you only need the message and the friend you want to send it to. Connects to the POD to send as to receive
|Sender|The sender is called from the manager. This receives the message and the friend's ID and connects with the POD to leave the message in their inbox
|Reader|It is sent by the manager every time the page is reloaded and connects to the POD and the POD brings back all the messages in the inbox
|POD|You have an inbox folder which is where you store the messages
|===

=== Friends

image::Level2Friends.png[]

Contained blackboxes:

|===
|Friends|It is the component where everything related to friends is drawn
|AddFriend|It is a service that is responsible for adding a friend by their webID
|DeleteFriend|It is a service that is responsible for removing a friend from the friends list
|getFriends|It is responsible for listing the friends of the POD. Changes to add and delete friends are also transmitted
|CheckID|Auxiliary method that checks if the id is correct
|FriendAlreadyExit|Auxiliary method that verify if you are already a friend of the friend you want to add

.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.
****

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

_**<Overview Diagram>**_

Motivation::

_<text explanation>_


Contained Building Blocks::
_<Description of contained building block (black boxes)>_

Important Interfaces::
_<Description of important interfaces>_

[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.
****


==== <Name black box 1>

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

_<Purpose/Responsibility>_

_<Interface(s)>_

_<(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics>_

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_




==== <Name black box 2>

_<black box template>_

==== <Name black box n>

_<black box template>_


==== <Name interface 1>

...

==== <Name interface m>



=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

==== White Box _<building block 1>_

[role="arc42help"]
****
...describes the internal structure of _building block 1_.

...

==== White Box _<building block m>_


_<white box template>_



=== Level 3

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.
