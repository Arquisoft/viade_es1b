In this part of the documentation we will write about some risks and technical debts we will face in the development of this project.

|Risk |Explanation
|Technologies |All the technologies we have to use in the application are news to us, so is a risk working with all of these applications and technologies.
|Teamates |Working with so much people in a team without knowing each others is a risk in the development of the application.
|Time |We have to do other subjects this semester, and this can become a problem for the development of this application.

|Technical Debt | Explanation
|Use of a SOLID template | We have decided to use a standard template with SOLID and React but it has a lot of classes and code we don't know, the options are to start from scratch reusing the useful components or clean all the code possible from the template.
