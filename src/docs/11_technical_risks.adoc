|Technologies |All the technologies we have to use in the application are news to us, so is a risk working with all of these applications and technologies.
|Teamates |Working with so much people in a team without knowing each others is a risk in the development of the application.
|Time |We have to do other subjects this semester, and this can become a problem for the development of this application.
