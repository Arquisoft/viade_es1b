=== How does the application login work?

* Shows the login of the application and how the whole process works. 
* A user enters their credentials in the login interface. Then, that interface sends the request to the authenticator, which in turn validates the data on the SOLID server. From here, two situations can occur:
	** The first is that the session is correct and then loads the new graphical interface (that of the application) and then loads its own routes from its own POD.
	** The second option is that the login is invalid, which causes the graphical interface of the login to be loaded again with an error message.
* Notably,the SOLID server is different from the user's POD.
